The affected region involves the frontal, parietal, and likely temporal lobes, predominantly subcortical and cortical structures within classic MCA distribution, sparing the basal ganglia. Such a hypodensity pattern represents loss of gray-white matter differentiation and cytotoxic edema typical of established infarction, suggesting the patient is already outside the favorable window for tissue salvage.

The probability value is moderately high, but the clinical relevance is questionable without neurological deficit.

The net-water uptake (NWU) is notably increased, especially in the right striatocapsular region (9.1%) and insula (4.7%), supporting the diagnosis of established infarction. The LVO predictive algorithm estimates an LVO score of 45.1 (\\'Possible\\'), indicating a moderate-to-high likelihood of a major vessel occlusion, even though hyperdense artery sign or definite clot was not visualized. These findings are consistent with a pathophysiological scenario of a large vessel occlusion (most likely proximal or distal M1/M2 MCA), with extensive early infarction already established within the MCA distribution.\",\\n    \"aiCritique\": \"The AI correctly detected large, confluent early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory and generated a plausible ASPECTS score reflecting extensive involvement. Key features such as HU differences and net-water uptake increase reinforce the acute and irreversible nature of the damage. However, the LVO score, though classified as \\'possible\\' (45.1), does not cross the highest \\'suggestive\\' threshold, and no direct clot sign is present—this may be due to limitations intrinsic to NCCT (e.g., poor sensitivity for distal M1/M2 clots, absence of hyperdense vessel). The diagnosis of LVO thus remains presumptive from NCCT alone, and the true occlusion site cannot be precisely localized.
